#+TITLE: TODO

* Current state
Mined-Out! port is heavily under construction right now. Its 2D engine is ready for being expanded, but the gameplay, design etc is yet to come.

*Do not expect to get original experience right now!*

* Phase 1: Core Data & Logic (No Pyxel)

** DONE types.py - Define all data structures
** DONE config.py - Set constants
** DONE movement.py - Position logic (simplest, no dependencies)
** DONE minefield.py - Generation (depends on movement for validation)
** DONE pathfinding.py - Validation (depends on minefield)
** DONE proximity.py - Mine counting (depends on minefield, movement)
** DONE level.py - Level configs (depends on config)
** DONE scoring.py - Score calculation (pure math)
** DONE replay.py - Replay logic (pure data transformation)

* Phase 2: State Management

** DONE game.py - Wire everything together

* Phase 3: Pyxel Integration

** DONE renderer.py - Drawing
main.py - Game loop
